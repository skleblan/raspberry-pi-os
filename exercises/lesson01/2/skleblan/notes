the goal of exercise 2 is to use the PL011 UART instead of the mini-uart

instead of alt5 (for gpio conf), we'll want alt0
alt5 is for mini-uart (uart1). alt0 is for uart0 (PL011)
this way we can use the same pins

13.4 Register View
The PL011 UART is mapped on base adderss 0x7E201000. It has the following memory-
mapped registers.

DR Register

Synopsis The UART_DR Register is the data register. For words to be transmitted:
if the FIFOs are enabled, data written to this location is pushed onto the
transmit FIFO.
if the FIFOs are not enabled, data is stored in the transmitter holding register
(the bottom word of the transmit FIFO).
The write operation initiates transmission from the UART. The data is prefixed
with a start bit, appended with the appropriate parity bit (if parity is enabled),
and a stop bit. The resultant word is then transmitted.
For received words:
if the FIFOs are enabled, the data byte and the 4-bit status (break, frame,
parity, and overrun) is pushed onto the 12-bit wide receive FIFO
if the FIFOs are not enabled, the data byte and status are stored in the
receiving holding register (the bottom word of the receive FIFO).
